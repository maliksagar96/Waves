# Waves
Simple plotting of stationary and travelling waves

This set of code contain 3 files. One is very straight forward which can be used for general purpose of printing of your X and Y axes.

The other two contain code to print 2 type of plane waves. Stationary which are represented as y = Acos(kx)cos(wt) and travelling waves as y = Acos(kx-wt).

Both are plotted with quite an easy code to understand.
